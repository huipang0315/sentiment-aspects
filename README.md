Repository consist of works on aspect-based sentiment analysis, compared and 
visualized how the attitude of chosen aspects (especially persons, countries) changed over time. In the analysis aspect-based sentiment analysis tool was used; it was described and published last year (Augustyniak, 2016). PWR used a subset of events related to Brexit gathered through the EventRegistry system. One of the unusual results of the analysis was in it showing that whether the term U.K. was used related attitudes was more negative, on the other hand, the term UK (without the dots) presented a much more positive sentiment. We investigated such phenomena and found that term U.K. is mostly used by United States news sources (such as USA Today). United Kingdom news sources use term UK instead.
