# Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
Repository consist of works on aspect-based sentiment analysis, compared and 
visualized how the attitude of chosen aspects (especially persons, countries)
 changed over time. In the analysis aspect-based sentiment analysis tool was 
 used; it was described and published in 2016 [1]. PWR used a subset of 
 events related to Brexit gathered through the EventRegistry system 
 [http://eventregistry.org/](http://eventregistry.org). One of 
 the unusual results of the analysis was in it showing that whether the term 
 **U.K.** was used related attitudes was more negative, on the other hand, the 
 term **UK** (without the dots) presented a much more positive sentiment. We 
 investigated such phenomena and found that term **U.K.** is mostly used by 
 United States news sources (such as USA Today). United Kingdom news sources 
 use term **UK** instead.

## Demo
